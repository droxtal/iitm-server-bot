                Right now I can't do much. Seriously, your pet can do more tricks than me.
                If you have any ideas or feature suggestion for me please put them in #server-suggestions. My devlopers would love to have your suggestions.
                If you yourself want to teach me new tricks head over to https://github.com/droxtal/iitm-server-bot
                
                Here's a quick guide to use the /help command
                1. Type '/help' (without quotes)
                2. Hit space
                3. Type a command name that you want to know more about. You can refer the list of bot's slash commands that discord provides.
                
                Syntax: /help <some command>
